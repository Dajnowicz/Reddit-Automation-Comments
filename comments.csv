"i initally wrote a python script to update the ntp addresses of 1200 connected traffic signal control devices for a city it worked great and i got the praise for saving man hours but i decided to not stop there 

 there was a daily need to allow all stakeholders of the traffic network to see the statuses of all network devices and some other data so i made a daily script that would run and climb the network get the status / data from traffic control devices then parse to a kml file which would display the device at the correct coordinates on google earth with status coloring and data getting the coordinate for all the devices was a python chore in itself tons and tons of data in a million different excel sheets i got pretty good at parsing and dicts by the end of it 

 i 'm bummed that i left that code when i left that job but i had intentions on making it real time and restful would of have been my coolest piece of code in the last few years 

 you think they would have just invested in solarwinds though or as /r / rockuu pointed out a dns server 

 edit i just had a nice write up on a financial workflow app i 'm working on but my tired fingers just hit the back button and i lost like 7 paragraphs of ideas for you mobile probs hopefully i can still give you ideas i 'll try to sum it up 

 -cherrypy web / api server 

 processes json web request with manually entered financial invoice data from a web form to record in sql database 

 -built a workflow view to allow simple input of milestone tracking dates basically each invoice becomes a box on the screen boxes start on the left side then as dates get entered the box moves right column to column until it 's complete 

 allows for esigning of invoices 

 -when an invoice is esigned a python script takes the data from it and generates an excel check request form using pyopenxl check request then automatically ia emailed to people sent to a printer and written through smb to a protected share 

 -when a check gets printed it updates an external csv the external csv generated from some old vb program the finance department uses holds a printing date which is recorded into the database 

 also takes a json feed of organization domain / cert vendors and expiration dates from a windows ad server 

 server accesses a network drive to pull data from numerous excel workbooks updated by other people 

 this data is query able through a page in the web app this page calls to the server to generate an excel book through pyopenxl this book contains financial records and tools for forecasting 

 allows on the fly changing of key parameters through web page such as excel field locations by rows / cols 

 -recently found out my employer wants me too branch my workflow view and make it into an org chart for another department sounds weird but workflow milestone columns actually work great for holding list of names never doubt the power of code reuse

"eight or nine years ago while working for a very large web retailer the one you 're probably thinking of i wrote a script in python to 

 retrieve all ~~asins~~ skus with authorship data in specific categories of products from the catalog around one million records 
 retrieve all the author / creator records for those skus 20 - 40,000 records 
 retrieve all the records of the authors / creators from a books / music / media / games business program around 12,000 and 
 compare the author names against the customer names using the levenshtein distance to find authors and creators who had not signed up the find authors who had multiple accounts and also find creators who may have pen names that also have customer accounts over 65 million 

 these records were used to tie the accounts in different systems together so we could make the author link work on product pages find products the author wrote or co - wrote that were missing from their author pages and contact authors who should join the registered creator program 

 the fun part was that the standard developer workstation at the time had 4 gb of ram ran a 32-bit version of linux and could n't create a file larger than 4 gb either ext2fs   i had to use the existing identifiers as hashes they were well distributed to write them to multiple directories and dbm files for analysis 

 if i recall correctly on a 2.5 ghz single core machine it took a little more than an hour to create a report for all the possible author matches ranked by confidence   i did have to stage some of the data first like the product catalog which was an overnight batch job to reduce load on the catalog servers   the report was then used to associate authors with products and the customer records for the authors were used to contact them to verify their author pages and the products we assigned to them","years ago working large web retailer probably thinking wrote script python

"i had a lot of data to analyze resulting from a number of electron microscopy experiments i was a part of 

 i got tired of using an image software like imagej fiji or gimp to view some of the images just to look for interesting features in them then gather a list of x y coordinates of the interesting features to be passed into a python script to produce some plots from those features 

 i figured it would be pretty straightforward to wrap the entire analysis process into a nice gui 

 turns out the gui was easy pyqt + pyqtgraph but handling input from many data sources was a bit of a pain so then i wrote a standardized experiment configuration file format using yaml that would contain all the relevant parameters for each experiment and make the various data sets easy to load into my gui for visualization
